# Cave Story (doukutsu-rs)
This is doukutsu-rs (the best version of Cave Story) with the CS+ data files included in an easy-to-use bundle. Just download the 7z file from the releases section and extract it somewhere. I've created batch scripts to automatically create shortcuts on your desktop and start menu, but you can also do this manually (or skip it altogether).

## DISCLAIMER
Because this download contains the CS+ data files, you should check your local laws about downloading Copyrighted material. In Canada, it's legal for personal use, and it's legal in most places if you already own CS+.
**DO NOT SELL OR USE COMMERCIALLY!!!**

Nicalis owns all the rights to the CS+ data files.\
[doukutsu-rs](https://github.com/doukutsu-rs/doukutsu-rs) is an open-source reimplementation of the original freeware version of Cave Story.

**DMCA Notice:** If you are part of Nicalis (or a representative) and don't want the CS+ files here removed, feel free to DMCA this repository.
